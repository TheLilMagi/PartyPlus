Slightly modified the addon to allow an extra field box to add more information. This is good for saying Have Summon.
Used spaces instead of commas. Removed some spaces for a shorter post.
I suggest editing the file to adjust default values to the dungeon you run the most often, and to the channel number you use for world chat.
